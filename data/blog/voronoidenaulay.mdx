# Voronoi/Denaulay

## Pratyay Flexing.

Look at his cool fan-art of the Armored Titan from the show 'Attack on Titan'. The geometric structure of the armour that covers this titan's body translates really well into this low-poly look.

Turns out, rather than drawing each polygon normally using bezier polygons and paths, there's a more convenient way to do this, i.e. using Inkscape's inbuilt Voronoi diagram generator.

This tool generates a cool polygonal pattern given just a set of cleverly placed dots!

## The what, a brief introduction.

Imagine a lot of points on a plane. Observe how none of the points lie within the circumcircles of the triangles. Circumcircles are circles such that the triangle's vertices lie on its circumference. Now this is a Voronoi/Denaulay triangulaton. 

Guess, is it possible to draw such a form on 3 points on the same line? (nein.)

## Understanding using an example

The Voronoi diagram is a general solution to 2D proximity problems.
A sample of the problems addressed by this technique include Closest Pair, All Nearest
Neighbors, Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree, Triangulation and Nearest Neighbor Search.

Now, let's consider the example of vacation spots. or anything. Ordinarily, you'd choose the one that is the closest.

Mathematically, the problem we are trying to solve is the following: Given a set `S` of `n`points
in the plane, we wish to associate with each point s a region consisting of all points in the
plane closer to `s` than any other point `s'`.
in `S`. This can be described formally as:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
$$\operatorname{Vor}(s)=\left\{p: \text { distance }(s, p) \leq \text { distance }\left(s^{\prime}, p\right), \forall s^{\prime} \in S\right\}$$
</div>

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<Image alt="ocean" src="/static/images/vor/3.png" width={400} height={400} />
</div>

The figure above is what we call a Voronoi diagram. 

The black dots represent the vacation spots, and the entire rectangle represents the whole region. On basis of proximity to the spots, the town is divided into colourful cells! 

Such diagrams that encode proximity information, help us answer questions like, '*Which shop is nearest to point A?'.*

Now, think about how you would measure distance between 2 places. There are several distance metrics you could use, the simplest and most familiar of all being the Euclidean distance. (The one resembling the pythagora's formula, yes.)

However, one could just as easily use alternative measures of distance, say for instance, the Manhattan distance between two points, which is:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
$$d\left[\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right),\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right)\right]=\left|x_{1}-x_{2}\right|+\left|y_{1}-y_{2}\right|$$
</div>

This new measure yields the following diagram for the same input points:

</div>

## Making Voronoi Diagrams

There are many intuitive methods to construct a Voronoi region for a given point s in set
`S`. 

 1. We can take all of the perpendicular bisectors of the segments connecting s to the
remaining members of `S`. 
 2. We can then use these rays to delimit half-planes. 

The intersection of all half-planes containing `s` is the Voronoi region for `s`. 

Alternatively, we can start with the segments connecting `s` to all remaining members of `S`. We then gradually extend lines outward along the perpendicular bisector of these segments until they intersect.

Finally, the Voronoi diagram is the union of all the Voronoi regions in the set, mathematically, it would look like this:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
$$\operatorname{Vor}(S)=\bigcup_{s \in S} \operatorname{Vor}(s)$$
</div>

## Enter Graph Theory

Formally, a Voronoi diagram is a planar graph where every vertex has degree *three.* Its complexity is linear, i.e. for *n* sites, there are *n* faces, at most *2n-5* vertices, and at most *3n-6* edges. (Let's say the complexity refers to the degree of sites/faces )


In graph theory, a *dual graph* of a plane graph **`G`** is a graph that has a vertex for each face of **`G`**.

Each edge of **`G`** has a *dual-edge* whose endpoints are the *dual-vertices* corresponding to the faces on either side of the edge.

A *triangulation* of a set of points **`P`** in a plane is a partition of the convex hull (the smallest [convex set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_set) that contains **`P`**) into [simplices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex) (triangles, in the 2D case), such that they satisfy the following conditions. 

- The union of all these simplices equals the convex hull
- Any pair of these intersect in a *(possibly empty)* common face.

 Interestingly enough, **it turns out that `DT(P)` (Delaunay triangulation using a discrete set of points P) corresponds to the *dual graph* of the Voronoi diagram for `P`.**


## Divide And Conquer Algorithm for Voronoi Construction

The naive approach consists of constructing Voronoi regions for each input point, i.e. for each $p_i$, construct $\operatorname{Vor}\left(p_{i}\right)=\bigcap_{j \neq i} H_{i j}$

Disadvantages:\
• It can cause inconsistency due to precision problems\
• It does not produce immediate neighborhood information\
• It runs in $O(n^2 \log n)$ time

Divide and Conquer Approach:

In this algorithm, one recursively draws a line to split the vertices into two sets. The Voronoi Region / Delaunay triangulation is computed for each set, and then the two sets are merged along the splitting line. Using some clever tricks, the merge operation can be done in time $O(n)$, so the total running time is $O(n \log n)$.

Sketch of logic:

- Let `P` be a set of n points in the plane.
- If the points are vertically partitioned into two subsets `R` and `B`:
- Consider the Voronoi diagram of the sets `R` and `B`
- We observe that the Voronoi diagram of `P` substantially coincides with the Voronoi diagrams of `R` and `B`!
- In fact, there exists a monotone chain of edges of `Vor(P)` such that `Vor(P)` coincides with
`Vor(R)` to the left of the chain, and with `Vor(B)` to its right.
